# Isotope
**Powerful USB HID emulation toolkit**

Isotope is a toolkit designed to enable USB HID emulation (Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick etc.) for the Raspberry Pi (and in theory, the BeagleBone Black or other Linux micro-devices) through the use of a paired ATmega32u4 over a UART connection. It aims to simplify the task of emulation by providing a bundled firmware for the ATmega32u4 as well as pre-built libraries for emulation operations.
